## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.

## Setup Laravel

 Please make sure that you intall composer on your machine.
 
 Please reffer the following post to install the composer on your local machine 
 https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-install-composer
 
 Use any one option to install the laravel on your local machine.
 
-$ composer global require laravel/installer
-$ laravel new “project name”

------------------OR------------------------
-$ composer create-project --prefer-dist 						 
-$ laravel/laravel “project name”

## Run 
	$php artisan serve

It will run on the http://127.0.0.1:8000 please visit.

## Database connection

Just copy the all content from the root of your setup project .env-example file and create a new file with name .env with database credentials.If you are using the composer then you do not need to do anything just put the your database credential in .env file and run the application

	DB_CONNECTION=mysql
	DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
	DB_PORT=3306
	DB_DATABASE="your database name"
	DB_USERNAME="your user name"
	DB_PASSWORD="your password"

## Helpfull Commands

- Model creation
		
		$ php artisan make:model “name of module” -m

- Migrate tables 

		$ php artisan migrate

- Database seeding 

		$ php artisan make:seeder “Name of seeder”
		$ php artisan db:seed --class=”Name of the seeder”

- Controller Creation

		$ php artisan make:controller “Name of Controller”

## Responce code

- 200: OK. The standard success code and default option. 
- 201: Object created. Useful for the store actions. 
- 204: No content. When an action was executed successfully, but there is no content to return. 
- 206: Partial content. Useful when you have to return a paginated list of resources. 
- 400: Bad request. The standard option for requests that fail to pass validation. 
- 401: Unauthorized. The user needs to be authenticated. 
- 403: Forbidden. The user is authenticated, but does not have the permissions to perform an action. 
- 404: Not found. This will be returned automatically by Laravel when the resource is not found. 
- 500: Internal server error. Ideally you're not going to be explicitly returning this, but if something unexpected breaks,
   this is what your user is going to receive. 
- 503: Service unavailable. Pretty self explanatory, but also another code that is not going to be returned explicitly by the
  application.
